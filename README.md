# Kickstart My Chart
This exercise leverages the features of MS Excel to analyze selected Kickstarter data from 2009 to mid-2017. I cleaned and formatted over 4100 entries, and used pivot tables and charts to highlight particular interesting trends and dynamics in the data. This repo contains the Excel file, as well as a paper detailing my insights and analysis.
